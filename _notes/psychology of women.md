There were three
camps that dominated the psychology of gender and that vocally opposed the
application of evolutionary theory: social constructionism, cognitive learning
theories, and social role theory.

### Social constructionists
This school of thought claim that gender
is perpetrated and main-
tained by the social constructionists. It also states 
that the distinction between men and women is a collec-
tive and tyrannical fiction and that there are no real biological or psychological differences other than ones that we construct through discourse. 

But elsewhere in the social sciences some academics were indeed resorting
to “social determinism.” Sex differences come from outside the child. Babies
are not born wanting to play football or dress dolls. These preferences are im-
posed by parents and the media, and then encoded into children’s cognitive
frameworks, magnifying and reifying the differences between masculine and
feminine behavior.

Socialization explanations of sex differences were built on the foundation of
the tabula rasa infant coaxed, rewarded, and punished until it conformed to
societal demands for sex-appropriate behavior. They took shape in the era of
behaviorism and learning theory. The account was a simple one. Parents treat
boys and girls differently, reinforcing the correct behavior in each. Boys are en-
couraged to fight, climb trees, and play football. Girls are forced to wear dresses,
play with dolls, and share. 

*Studies:*
A six months old baby was wrapped in a blue or a pink blanket, identified as a boy or a girl,
and then handed to a woman who was asked to look after it for a few minutes.

Cognitive Learning Theory

Children have a natural tendency to think categorically. They form categories
about all sorts of things from animals to sports and it would be surprising if they
did not, very early in life, form categories of male and female. Once these cat-
egories are formed, all incoming information that is gender typical gets shunted
into the correct binary slot and over time a stereotype is built up about what
males and females look like, do, and enjoy
