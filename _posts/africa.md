# Why Is Africa Is So Poor?

---

## Introduction

We all know that Africa is the poorest continent in the world, and this poverty can be linked to one major factor. A factor that is independent of the peoples behaviour and how they act, something that has been present since the existence of humanity and the people have little or no power over it.

## History

Before we begin I would like us to take a brief look at history. Africa is considered to be the origin of humanity, where all humans originated from and there are so many evidence to prove this. And by virtue of this reason they happen to be a wide range of cultures, tribes, languages and ethnicity in Africa compared to other continents.

So many cultures and tribes all over the world can always link back their origin to somewhere in Africa.

- The \_\_\_\_
- Make Like 5-7 list

This brings us back to our original question, Why is Africa still and so poor?
And what those the origin of humanity has to do with WAISP.
Hold tight, we are getting there.

## Misconception

Most people believe that the problems in Africa today are primarily caused by corruption, war, illiteracy and a high population rate.

While these are not far from the truth, because indeed all these factors have really lead to the consistent backsliding of most African nations there is still one unique factor that stands out, that all other factors can be linked to, that has eaten deep into the roots of Africa and it’s still eating their system till date.

And it is for this reason you it would always remain unfair to compare African nations to other Western /Eastern States in the world today.

The one factor, peculiar to Africa, that has shaped the continents and its people to the way they are today, running accross every sector, influencing the way nations and their government is run is:

## Diversity

Yes Diversity,

Diversity is one thing that has shaped every part of Africa to the way it is now, either directly or indirectly. Diversity can have both it’s positive and negative effect on a population. To elaborate more on this think for a moment, how can the most diverse nation be the United State (has at least one person from every tribe and nation in the world.

- **Positive Side of Diversity**
  A survey carried out over the years has reflected that US has been the country with the most immigrants for the past 100 years) while the most diverse continent be Africa.
  The US and other world leading countries (such as France, ) have a high level of diversity, possessing a structure that welcomes people from other part of the globe. This has lead to lots of successful business collaboration and in a long run growth is all these parts of the world. A nation occupied by a wide range of diverse people has to always make policies that would be favourable to everyone and treat people more like equals.

- **Negative Side of Diversity - Ethnicity**
  While a nation like US may be highly diverse, this does not mean they are truly genetically diverse. Immigration has played a very key role in the diversity of nations like US, France and the likes. North America has basically 6 distinct ethnic groups.

Africa is the most genetically diverse nation in the world, having over 3,000 ethnic groups, speaking more than 2,100 Different Languages In All Of Africa.

### Continents and their ethnic groups

| Continent     | Ethinic Groups Count |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Africa        | > 3000               |
| Asia          | 6                    |
| Europe        | 87 distinct          |
| North America | 6 distinct           |
| South America | 7 major              |
| Oceania       |                      |
| Antartica     |                      |

_Ethnicity is ——_

Each ethnic group (tribe) is like a kingdom or an empire of its own. Having its historic culture and language. And as such most African nations is like a collection of smaller kingdoms and empires.

The bond between the people of a certain tribe is way stronger than you can imagine. People don’t mind sacrificing the health of a nation for the wellbeing of their minor tribe.
This has lead to a high level of corruption in the government sector and politics all over Africa.
Although most of these African nations has been formed through the amalgamation of several tribes by Colonial masters. This was done based on their political & self interest, to enable them have more people under their control. But what they never knew was that they had set into motion a war that would never end especially in tribes that do not agree.

For this reason African nations has always been at war, especially within the various tribes .

Of the world's 20 war-related conflicts in 2013, 11 alone were fought on the African continent - all in sub-Saharan Africa. This includes the wars in Sudan and South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, Mali, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.

And the consequences of this war, the aftermath of this war will always leave the country in more ruins and a raise in poverty. Most of these tribes find it almost impossible to live together and as such conflict is inevitable.

When there is war, education becomes something of less importance hence, illiteracy. Hospitals and other health facilities will be deficient of skilled personnels and as low technical-know-how. In a long run this conflict affects every single sector, economy crashes, issues of insecurity on the rise, people doing whatever they can to survive which will definitely lead to more crimes and at last backwardness and poverty in all of Africa.

## Conclusion

It is difficult for people with different beliefs, mindset, vision and perception to live together and make a tangible progress. Most of their actions will always lead to conflict as they all see themselves as different people. Africans are the greatest discriminators and racist of all time.

## Questions for the day

- If Africa was never Colonised would things have been better?
- What do you think can be a solution to this negative side effects of Diversity.
