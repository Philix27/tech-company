## A new way of operating

“Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating.” —John Cleese

1. You don't have to be a genius
### Find a Scenius
 
A Scenius is like a group of people sharing ideas and opinions on a common topic.
This can be groupchats, discord groups, forums, blog post - quora, medium, linkedin e.t.c.

### Be an amateur
“That’s all any of us are: amateurs. We don’t live long enough to be
anything else.” —Charlie Chaplin

Amateurs purse their work in full spirit. They aren't scared of loosing and they believe
there are so many possibilities unlike the expert. 
The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about
what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.
Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.

### You can't find your voice if you don't use it

- “Find your voice, shout it from the rooftops, and keep doing it until the
people that are looking for you find you.” — Dan Harmon

Finding our voice in our today's society where it seems everything has already been talked about
might sound difficult or impossible, but the truth by speaking of the things you
love, (regardless of if someone has talked about it in the past) you will definitely attract
people who also love this same ideas of yours. 

Learn to share you ideas with the public, and if what you are working on isn't online in our
today's society then it doesn't exist.

### Read Obituaries

- “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I
know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are
already naked.” —Steve Jobs

Most times we don’t like talking about death, or how we are going to die. We always need to 
remeber that and if so we truly have nothing to lose. 

Near death experience has motivated so many great people in history and there is a reason for that.
(e.g George Saunders, Tim Kreider,). Fact remains that none of us would want a near-death experience
in order to be motivated to startup something or go public, that is where the idea
of reading obituaries comes in handy. 

It's like a coward's near-death experience, consisting of stories of how one lived he/her life.
This further prompts us to start deciding how our obituaries would look like by 
putting our work out there so that we can be known for something.

2. Think Process, not Product.

### Take people behind the scene

- “A lot of people are so used to just seeing the outcome of work. They never
see the side of the work you go through to produce the outcome.” —Michael Jackson

There's this belief that only the finished product or any work is to be seen or publized. 
This was often the case in time past especially before the coming of the internet. A 
situation whereby we can only see a movie without having an ide of how it was made, 
or a painting with no one having an idea of the process involded in coming out with such 
masterpiece.

“The private details of artmaking are
utterly uninteresting to audiences,” write Bayles and Orland, “because they’re
almost never visible—or even knowable—from examining the finished work.”

This all made sense in a pre-digital age, when the only way an artist could
connect with an audience was through a gallery show or write-up in some fancy
art magazine. But today, by taking advantage of the Internet and social media, an
artist can share whatever she wants, whenever she wants, at almost no cost.

The fact remains “People really do want to see how the sausage gets made.”


### Become a Documentarian of what you do

- “In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen—
really seen.” —Brené Brown

Documenting your work is a more perfect way of showing how far you have gone on a 
certain project. Especially on a more frequent interval, it reveals your 
work in steps and this serves as a real evidence that it is your work and
it can also serve as a source of motivation.


3. Share something small everyday.

### Send out a daily dispatch

- “Put yourself, and your work, out there every day, and you’ll start meeting
some amazing people.” —Bobby Solomon

Overnight success is a myth. Dig into almost every overnight success story and
you’ll find about a decade’s worth of hard work and perseverance. Building a
substantial body of work takes a long time—a lifetime, really—but thankfully,
you don’t need that time all in one big chunk. So forget about decades, forget
about years, and forget about months. Focus on days.

A daily dispatch is even better than a résumé or a portfolio, because it shows
what we’re working on right now.

The form of what you share doesn’t matter. Your daily dispatch can be anything
you want—a blog post, an email, a tweet, a YouTube video, or some other little
bit of media. There’s no one-size-fits-all plan for everybody.

Don’t worry about everything you post being perfect.

### The "So What?" Test

“Make no mistake: This is not your diary. You are not letting it all hang
out. You are picking and choosing every single word.”
—Dani Shapiro


As publicist Lauren Cerand
says, “Post as though everyone who can read it has the power to fire you.”
Be open, share imperfect and unfinished work that you want feedback on, but
don’t share absolutely everything.

If you don't feel comfortable about it, save it for future review or toss it 
aside. Make sure what you are to publish is of value.

### Turn your Flow into Stock

“If you work on something a little bit every day, you end up with something
that is massive.” —Kenneth Goldsmith

- Flow is the feed. It’s
the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people you exist. 
- Stock is
the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months
(or two years) as it is today. Stock is best made by collecting, organizing, and
expanding upon your flow. 
The magic formula is to maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background.


### Build A Good (Domain) Name

- “Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express
yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments
you can make with your time.” —Andy Baio

Go register a domain name.
Buy www.[insert your name here].com. If your name is common, or you don’t
like your name, come up with a pseudonym or an alias, and register that.

Setup a blog and keep posting consistently. Do not neglect it for other social 
media platforms. This should represent all your works. 

4. Open up your cabinent of curiosities.

### Don't be a hoarder.

- “The problem with hoarding is you end up living off your reserves.
Eventually, you’ll become stale. If you give away everything you have, you
are left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish. . . .
Somehow the more you give away, the more comes back to you.” —Paul Arden

“You’re only as good as your record collection.” —DJ Spooky

### No Guilty Pleasures.

“I don’t believe in guilty pleasures. If you f---ing like something, like it.” —Dave Grohl
