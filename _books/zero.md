### Brief Summary 

This book talks about creating new things and coming up with innovative ideas. That is the only way to stay afloat in today's market and than is how the big tech giants are able to keep moving. Upgrading or updating an existing idea/product is like moving from 1 to *n*, but creating something new is moving from *zero to one*.  

### Challenge of the future:

The future is something we can not predict but we are sure it will be different from what we have today. If nothing chnanges then we still haven't reached or gotten to the future. Therefore, in order to get to the future there are two forms of progress we can make: the horizontal/extensive progress (which involves copying things, globalization,easier to acheive, a typical example - China)  and the verticlal/intensive progress (creating/doing new things, more difficult, takes longer time - US).

Creating something new in a big company can often times be tough because of the so many heirarchies of command and buereaucracies. Running a small startup/company on the other hand is twices harder because lots of funds and assistance will be needed from other skilled personnels.

### Party like it's 1999
### All Happy Companies are different
- What valuable company is no one building? This is a question to consider when setting up a company. A company that stands out and can be run as a monopoly. \
