# Ego is the Enemy

---

### Painful Prologue

I wrote this book not because I have attained some wisdom I feel qualified to
preach, but because it’s the book I wish existed at critical turning points in my
own life.

While the author became successful at a very early
stage in life, he learnt that no success story is truly complete.
_Leaving out the ugly side of things most a times._
He started well but over time he began facing tough
challenges which costed him alot of his fourtunes and
good name and most of these was as a result of **Ego**,
which is often associated with success, ambitions and accomplishments.

- _The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. —RICHARD FEYNMAN_

### Introduction

Wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego.

## Part I - ASPIRE

We are setting out to do something new, something innovative
after coming up with a great idea, many a times we tend not to
reach our final destination due to our ego and lack of humility.

Facts are better than dreams: While we may have great visions and dreams
we should also learn to detach ourselves from thatese
aspirations and see tings for what they truly are - self awareness.

### Talk, Talk, Talk

- _Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know. - Lao Tzu_

We have to be concious about the things we say for there will always
be temptation to talk and hype instead of taking action and doing the work.

Talking is highly encourage in our modern day society especially via social media
platforms were we are
always being promted to say what's
on our mind or make a tweet, which futher leads us to talking.

Sometimes silence isn't a sign or thesame as weaknss.
Silence could mean strength especially in the early stages of our journey towards our goals.

To express what is still in thought could weaken actions.

The more difficult the task, the more uncertain the outcome,
the more costly talk will be and futher we run from actual accountability.

The relationship between work and chatter is that on kills the other.

### To Be or To Do

Colonel John Boyd usually adviced young soldiers -  
One day you would have to make this decision: To Be or To Do.

**To Be:** Make compromises, turn your back on friends
especially for politics, recognition, incentives, commitments e.t.c.

**To Do:** Be yourself, Set principles, Doing what you love most for genuine reasons.

Apperance can be deceiving, network, size of paychecks, job titles, number of fans or followers e.t.c.
Choices you make on a daily basis defines who you become (especially what you give your time and resources to).

### Become a student

By being a student you place your ego in another person's hand.
You have to be humble to learn because education cannot be hacked, neither can you fool your teacher.

A student constly strive to learn more and improve. Always seek for feedback especially
from genuine people (such as your superiors) who aren't scared to tell you the truth.
Family and friends will always try to please you.

Ego would make one see only the positive feedback, and
rationalize every other opposing opinions to suit his feeling.

### Don't be Passionate

While one maybe passionate about their desires and aspirations, we are
to note that sometimes it could hinder us from accomplishments. We should be driven
by reasons rather than passion.

Being passionate may make one blind to the world of reality and deaf to the opinions
of friends. The origin of passion may be earnest and good, but its effect
maybe comical and monstrous.

Being passionate can be paradoxical, where a person can say things he/she wish to
accomplish, display the plans they have and have no significant progress to show for it.

What we need in place of _Passion_ is _Purpose_. Purpose is like passion, but with boundaries.
Realism is detachment from this passion and with varied perspective to see things more clearly.

### Follow the canvas strategy

Encourages one to be a humble apprentice/intern. Most great artist in history such as
Michealangelo and Leonardo Davinci started off as an apprentice.

Forget about the glory and the praises at the early stage. Meanwhile,
this shouldn't be mistaken for kissing asses but rather others the opportunity to take the lead.
Obeisance is the way forward. When starting out you are most likely to
overestimate your abilities.
The Canvas Strategy is teaches us about helping others to help you.
Whenever you are in a place, look for how to add value to them and in return
you will benefit from it.

Sacrifice short-term gratification for long-term pay-offs.

### Restrain Yourself

Sometimes we have to retrain ourselves from attacking even when we
feel we mustor we are being oppressed. All for the bigger picture/goal.
One needs to tolorate and endure a certain some shit in order to acheive a a certain goal.
Be ready to put aside basic sense of fairness and rights you deserve as a human being.

Whatever we aspire to acheive in some ways is defined by the amount of nonsense we are willing to deal with.
Ignore the noise; Quietly brush it off and work harder.

### Get out of your own head

_A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch
with reality and lives in a world of illusions._ **ALAN WATTS**

Sometimes our past glory, history or previous acheivements may hinder us from reaching our
goals because we tend to dwell on them. The more creative we are, the likely are we
to loose touch of reality and get stuck in our own head, overemphasizing our importance.

Learn to live clearly and presently. Don't lie in the haze of the abstract.
Live with the tangible and real especially when it is uncomfortable.

### The Danger of Early Pride

- _A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are
  looking down, you cannot see something that is above you._
  **—C. S. LEWIS**

This section focuses on how pride can lead to ones downfall.
Especially pride that comes after temporary success. Pride can lead to a myopic view of a situation.
Learn to protect your ego and pride from people who make you feel too good.
Always seek for others feedback and point of view or perspective.
Be on guard against wild self-confidence and self-obession.
The first prdouct of self-knowledge is humility.

Again, just because you are quiet doesn’t mean you are without pride. Don't boast, there
is nothing in it for you.

### Work, Work Work

- _The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into work. —PETER DRUCKER_
- _You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do -Henry Ford_

It is not enough to have big dreams and aspirations but rather
put in the hardwork to make that awesome idea a reality. It also needs to be
understood that it is not just working to attain a certain goal, but to work, work, forever and ever.

Ego mskes us have this illusion of making progress without we actually doing any accountable work.
It makes us to go about telling friends about the work we plan or hope on doing.

- Bill Bradley would say to himeself "Whenever you are not practising, remeber someone somewhere is
  practising, and when you met him, he will win".

### For everything that comes next, ego is the enemy

## Part II - SUCCCESS

Having acheived our desired goals and aspirations we are
faced with another form of challenge,
temptation and problems. We stop learning, stop listening,
stop growing and we loose our grasp on what matters.

We become victims of ourselves and the competitions.
Sobriety, open-mindedness, organisation and purpose are the great stabilizers.

We tend to forget the factors which made us successful right after we have acheived our goals.
Ego wants us to think _I'm special. I'm better. The rules don't apply to me._

No matter how hard you may have worked, the hurdles you may have overcome, once
you attain success ego is coming for you - especially at your highest moment.

Can you handle success? Or will it be the worst thing that ever happeed to you?

### Always Stay a Student

- _Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON_

It takes a special kind of humility to acknowledge that you know less even
as you learn moree and more. With accomplishments comes a growing pressure to show
that we know more than we do.
A humble person consistently observe and listen so as to improve. Learn cocnsistently, even as a boss.
Learn from everyone and everything.

When we are conviced of our intellegience we remain in our comfort zone which makes
us feel safe and we are never challenged to learn something new.
From time to time pick a book about a new topic/field, smething you are less knowledgable of.
Push yourself hard against that uncomfortable feeling that comes with learning something new.

### Don't Tell Yourself a Story

- _Myth becomes myth not in the living but in the retelling. —DAVID MARANISS_

Do not focus on the goal, but rather the process. Develop a standard of performance which ensures
the process is done properly.

By telling ourselves stories made up in our head we begin to feel like our
success was predictable and we saw it coming.

Facts are better than stories. We should stop going with the claim that things
went exactly as we planned it.

### What is important to you?

- _To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age. —ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON_

We startoff with a clear picture of what we want and desire,
but once we have acheived it or come close we loose sight of our
priorities and our core principles. We forget what is truly important.

Find out what is truly important to you, then fosake the rest.
Steve Jobs once said "Focus is sacrificing all other good and nice goals for one".

### Entitlement, Control, and Paranoia

- _One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is
  the belief that one’s work is terribly important. —BERTRAND RUSSELL_

Entitlement: This is mine. I have earned it. We overestimate/overstate our
abilities and lookdown on others.

Control: It must be done my way - even little things and inconsequential things.
Excessive control end up creating a toxic air around us and those who we work with.

Paranoia: I can’t trust anyone. I'm totally by myself and for myself.

- _He who indulges empty fears earns himeself real fears - Seneca_

### Managing Yourself

- _It is not enough to have great qualities; we should also have the management of them. —LA ROCHEFOUCAULD_

Delegate task and functions and know the difference between urgency and important.
You don’t have to do all the job else you overwork yourself.
As you become more successful your job begins to chnage gradually, from doing less to making
more decisions. The transition requires reevaluating and updating your role.

You would need to trust people to do some jobs for you.
Responsibility requires readjustment and increased clarity and purpose.

- Setting top-level goals and priorities.

### Beware the disease of me

- _If I am not for myself who will be for me? If I am only for myself, who am I? —HILLEL_

Disease of me is an act of constantly thinking of oneself, as a very important person and
deserving of all forms of recognition, honor and attention.
This stops you from seeing things for what the truly are and gives you this tendency to
satisfy your intrest at the expense of everyone else.

One of the most dangerous ironies of success is that we can become someone we never wanted after acheiving it.

### Meditate on the Immensity

- _A monk is a man who is separated from all and who is in harmony with all. —EVAGRIUS PONTICUS_

### Maintain your sobriety

Striggle to remain sober. Don't be carried away or deceived by the recognition you have gotten
or the amount of money you have gotten in your bank account.
Ego clouds your mind and sobriety can be a cue.

### For what often comes next, ego is the enemy...

We must try to avoid the undeiscplined pursuit for more. Once we are successful the need for
publicity, attention, celerity lifestyle usually arises, and it is at this stage Ego is capable
of destroying a man.We become delusional and assume the world revovles around us. A brief reminder
is that just because you did something once, doesn’t mean you’ll
be able to do it successfully forever.

## Part III - FAILURE

As we work towards our aspirations we should bear it in mind that
no one is permanently successful and not everyone finds success on
first attempt.

At any point in our journey life can take a twist, fate could happen, what
you least expect can happen to you, even your greatest fears do come into reality.
Sabotage, Unfairness, Adversity, Trials, Tragedy, all these should be seen as a trial
which are meant to build you else one might get sunk by it.

Sometimes failure has it advantages because it helps refine us, build and prepare us for
the future and futher unforseen circumstances. So the way we react towards failure matters
a lot.

In times of failure we need to be strong and posses the confidence and willingness to endure and
also a sense of purpose else our ego betray us.

### Alive or Dead Time

- _Live without wasted time - PARISIAN POLITICAL SLOGAN_

### The Effort is Enough

- _What matters to an active man is to do the right thing; whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him. —GOETHE_

In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even
perfectly. Yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy,
or even a resounding yawn from the world.
Depending on what motivates us, this response can be crushing. If ego holds
sway, we’ll accept nothing less than full appreciati

Sometimes doing just the work is enugh.
Though there may be times when the result we anticipate is not what we get i return,
but we just have to be contented
with the work we have done.

### The Effort is Enough

If you shut up truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow, and gather to itself such
explosive power that the day it bursts through it will blow up everything in its way.
—EMILE ZOLA

### The Fight Club

Sometimes we may experience illful things, bad experiences which may lower our spirit.
This sad times might have even been a product of our ego but one needs to settle down and
make a reassessment on previous actions and in the past. Figure out where you went wrong
so that you can learn from it and avoid making same mistake in future. Be humble.

### Draw The Line It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character.

—MARCUS AURELIUS The only real failure is abandoning your principles. Killing what you love
because you can’t bear to part from it is selfish and stupid. If your reputation
can’t absorb a few blows, it wasn’t worth anything in the first place.
Learn to draw the line, know when enough damage has been donw.
Then stop and have a rethink on how to resolve the problem on ground rather
than seeking for more dubvious means oas a solution.

### Maintain your own scorecard

For us, the scoreboard can’t be the only scoreboard. Warren Buffett has said
the same thing, making a distinction between the inner scorecard and the
external one. Your potential, the absolute best you’re capable of—that’s the
metric to measure yourself against. Your standards are. Winning is not enough.
People can get lucky and win. People can be assholes and win. Anyone can win.
But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves.

- Learn not to take anything too personal. Whether someone offends uyou,
  or steals your idea or tries to disgrace you,seize to retaliate or become
  aggressive because this may lead to your downfall. Always show love and hate will
  never catvh up with you.

- I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is in the work—the chance to
  find yourself. —JOSEPH CONRAD

Whatever is next for us, we can be sure of one thing we’ll want to avoid. Ego.
It makes all the steps hard, but failure is the one it will make permanent. Unless
we learn, right here and right now, from our mistakes. Unless we use this
moment as an opportunity to understand ourselves and our own mind better, ego
will seek out failure like true north.
