you for this bold step. Some of the things you need to consider include:

   energy and resources than you think which may futher affect your relationship and activities in the 
   family. It may lead tou to having less time for your children and wife. Is it really worth it?
2. **Face the fear:** Regular monthly income and allowances will no longer be available and this 
   new business will not be generating profits anytime soon. Will you be needing money for 
   other things outside the business?
3. **When in doubt, gut it out:** You may have some doubts about the business you are to 
   embark on which is fine, but you need to constantly remind yourself the core reason why you 
   want to start this very project.
4. **Think about partnering up:** It's actually tough starting and running a business alone, even 
   for the motivated overachievers. And it's also lonely at the top. Having someone that you can
    always relate to concerning the ups and down of a startup is highly important.
5. **Live Lean:** New business gobble up lots of cash so it is necessary to seek afor 
   every opportuity to save and make an extra penny. Also consider hiring only important and top-notch

   taxes, startup loans, inventory (as stocks increases), accounts receivable.

   no matter how good the ideas behind the busness may be, if there is no demand then you don't have a 
   business. Ask friends and take survey.

   websites, prices, services, how they attract customers and many more. So that you can use these

   make good network, connections and rapport with them.

   how they would react to such a business.

## Chapter 3 - Write your business plan
### Building your blueprint for success

Mere having the greatest business idea is not enough, one has to take the extra step to develop 
a business plan which enables you see things more clearly and also makes it easy for others (investors)
to understand what your business is all about.

### Some Standard Features of a Business Plan

1. Executive summary: Company’s mission, business objectives, target market, points of differentiation, 
marketing strategy, funding needs, and why it’s time to bring your vision to market.
2. Business breakdown: Begin with your *elevator speech*.  Next, detail your
products and services, market niches, and what makes you unique. Detail the size 
and demographics of your target market, the demand
for your offering, your expected market share, and the type of legal
business entity you plan to operate.
3. Competitive analysis: List your competitors’ locations, estimated
revenues, and marketplace history. Report on what they’re doing
right and wrong, how they’re meeting or not meeting their custom-
ers’ needs, and explain how you intend to neutralize their strengths
and exploit their vulnerabilities. Spell out why your offering gives you
a competitive advantage. Is it a patented new technology? A better
location? Greater convenience? Do your prices, service, or quality
give you an edge? How? Most important, how do you convince your
rivals’ customers to jump over to your side?
4. Management team: You need to assess each member of your team and make sure they are all providing 
adequate and quality value to the company, beacuse they will serve as a burden if
they are not competent.
5. Marketing strategy: Begin with an analysis of the space you’re enter-
ing: the competitive landscape, the growth opportunities, the niches
that make up the market. Plans on how you intend to advertise and promete this company.
6. Daily operations: Offer a glimpse into your day-to-day business,
starting with the workforce.
7. Risk assessment: Time to remove your rose-colored glasses and 
assume the role of devil’s advocate. Try to look out for any possible problem 
and see how it can affect this business and come up with plans on how to resolve it.
Explain how
you’ll avert the preventable crises and deal with the inevitable ones.
8. Sales forecast:  Estimate monthly revenue
and units sold for the first year. Do the same, but on an annual basis,
for the following four years. Then back up the numbers with detailed
underlying assumptions. Where to get the data? Start with competi-
tor and marketplace analysis, field research, trade associations, per-
haps focus groups. Pit the numbers against your sales objectives, and
account for any discrepancies.
9. Financial Analysis: Start with the pro forma profit-and-
loss (P&L) statement, projecting monthly income and expenses for
the first year. Do the same for the next couple of years, but on a quar-
terly basis. (Develop both conservative-case and best-case scenarios).
Put a number on how much funding you
need, and how you’ll spend and repay it. Finally, disclose your own
financial circumstances and how much you’ll personally contribute
to the business. Lenders and investors like to see entrepreneurs with
some skin in the game.

## Chapter 4 - Fund Finding
### Raising Capital Without Relinquishing Control


1. Bootstrapping. Funding your company with personal assets is
ideal for maintaining control but it can stall growth—and jeopardize
your financial future—if your pockets aren’t deep.
2. Family and Friends: Tapping loved ones for
funding is as common as it is dicey. If it turns out well, life is good.
If it doesn’t, lifelong relationships can turn sour. Treat these loans
like the serious business agreements they are. Present your case as if
your relatives were bankers: Quote a competitive interest rate and
payback terms, explain the risks. 
3. Banks. It’s all about collateral.
4. Angel Investors.
5. Venture Capitalists.
